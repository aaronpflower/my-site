/*
Grid consists of two core style classes:
(1) ".grid-row" class.  This is just a block level element used to contain columns and clear floats.  Use the grid-row class for each "row" of columns.

(2) ".col-" class.  This is a floated, block level element that will serve as a column to contain content.  Column classes are named according to their fraction of the parent container (e.g. col-1-3 would be 1/3 the width of the parent container).

To give the grid fixed widths add separate container classes as necessary.  The base ".grid-row" class has no specified width (and is therefore width: auto) to provide flexibility.

// CORE GRID STYLES -------------------------------

// grid-rows can be used stand alone or with a grid-container to limit width.
// NOTE: COLUMNS SHOULD BE PLACED IN GRID ROWS SO THEY ARE CLEARED PROPERLY.
